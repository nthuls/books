Yes, there are several techniques used in URL encoding, especially in the context of security and potential exploitation. Besides the `%` encoding and directory traversal using `..`, there are other methods and techniques as well.

### Common URL Encoding Techniques

1. **Percent Encoding (`%`):**
   - Most common method for encoding special characters in URLs.
   - Characters are replaced with a `%` followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the character's ASCII code.
   - Example: A space is encoded as `%20`.

2. **Directory Traversal (`../` or `..`):**
   - Used to navigate up in the directory structure.
   - Can be exploited to access files outside the intended directory.

3. **Double Encoding:**
   - Involves encoding characters twice.
   - Useful in bypassing filters that decode only once.
   - Example: `%` itself is encoded as `%25`, so `%20` could be encoded again as `%2520`.

4. **Overlong UTF-8 Encoding:**
   - Characters are encoded using more bytes than necessary in UTF-8.
   - This can bypass filters expecting non-standard encodings.

5. **Using Plus (`+`) for Spaces:**
   - Spaces can be represented by `+` in URLs.
   - Some systems treat `+` as a space, while others do not, leading to inconsistent filtering.

6. **Hexadecimal Dots (`.`):**
   - The dot character (.) can be encoded as `%2E`.
   - Useful for bypassing simplistic filters looking for literal dots in paths or file names.

### Techniques for Exploitation in Security Context

1. **SQL Injection via URL Encoding:**
   - Encoding SQL syntax to bypass web filters.
   - Example: Encoding `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - Encoding JavaScript or HTML for XSS attacks.
   - Characters like `<`, `>`, `'`, `"` are encoded to bypass filters.

3. **Path Injection/Traversal:**
   - Using encoded directory traversal techniques to access unauthorized files.

4. **Bypassing Input Validation:**
   - Encoding payloads to evade input validation checks.

### Security Measures

- **Robust URL Decoding:** Ensure all encoded URLs are fully decoded and checked.
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all inputs, including URLs.
- **Consistent Handling of Encoded Characters:** Treat encoded characters the same as their decoded counterparts in security checks.

### Conclusion

Understanding these URL encoding techniques is crucial for web security, as attackers can exploit them to bypass security filters and access restricted information. It's essential for web developers and security professionals to be aware of these methods to implement effective security measures against such vulnerabilities.
