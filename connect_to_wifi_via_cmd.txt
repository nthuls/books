To connect to a Wi-Fi network via Command Line or PowerShell, you typically use the `netsh` command on Windows. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Using Command Prompt or PowerShell:

1. **List all Wi-Fi profiles**:
    ```
    netsh wlan show profiles
    ```

    This will show you a list of all the Wi-Fi profiles saved on your computer.

2. **Connect to a Wi-Fi network**:

    If you've previously connected to the Wi-Fi network, it would have a saved profile. You can use:
    ```
    netsh wlan connect name="ProfileName"
    ```
    Replace `ProfileName` with the name of the Wi-Fi profile.

    If you haven't connected to the network before, you might not have a profile saved. In such cases, you'd first need to create a profile and then connect. This process is more involved as it requires you to set up an XML configuration file for the profile.

3. **Disconnect from a Wi-Fi network**:
    You can turn off your Wi-Fi using:
    ```
    netsh interface set interface "Wi-Fi" admin=disable
    ```
    And you can turn it back on using:
    ```
    netsh interface set interface "Wi-Fi" admin=enable
    ```

    Note: The adapter name "Wi-Fi" might vary based on your system configuration. Adjust it accordingly if you get an error.

### Connecting to a new Wi-Fi network:

If you're trying to connect to a new Wi-Fi network that doesn't have a profile saved on your computer, it's a bit more complex. You'd have to set up a profile using an XML configuration file, then add this profile, and then connect. Here's a basic idea:

1. **Create an XML file** with the following content:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <WLANProfile xmlns="http://www.microsoft.com/networking/WLAN/profile/v1">
        <name>YOUR_SSID</name>
        <SSIDConfig>
            <SSID>
                <hex>HEX_SSID</hex>
                <name>YOUR_SSID</name>
            </SSID>
        </SSIDConfig>
        <connectionType>ESS</connectionType>
        <connectionMode>manual</connectionMode>
        <MSM>
            <security>
                <authEncryption>
                    <authentication>WPA2PSK</authentication>
                    <encryption>AES</encryption>
                    <useOneX>false</useOneX>
                </authEncryption>
                <sharedKey>
                    <keyType>passPhrase</keyType>
                    <protected>false</protected>
                    <keyMaterial>YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD</keyMaterial>
                </sharedKey>
            </security>
        </MSM>
    </WLANProfile>
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_SSID` with the SSID of your network, `HEX_SSID` with the hex representation of your SSID, and `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD` with your Wi-Fi password.

2. **Add the profile**:
    ```
    netsh wlan add profile filename="path_to_xml_file.xml"
    ```

3. **Connect**:
    ```
    netsh wlan connect name="YOUR_SSID"
    ```

Keep in mind that the XML configuration provided above is a basic template for WPA2-PSK networks. Depending on the security type and settings of your Wi-Fi network, you might need to adjust the XML configuration accordingly.

Always be cautious when handling Wi-Fi profiles, especially in scripts, as they can sometimes expose sensitive data like Wi-Fi passwords.
