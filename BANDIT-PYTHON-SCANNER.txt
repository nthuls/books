Certainly! Bandit is a great tool for scanning Python code for security vulnerabilities. Let's go through how to use Bandit step-by-step:

### 1. **Running Bandit on Your Project**:

To scan your entire Python project, navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
bandit -r .
```

Here:
- `-r` or `--recursive` tells Bandit to scan files in the given directory and all subdirectories.
- `.` specifies the current directory.

### 2. **Understanding Bandit's Output**:

When you run Bandit, it will provide output that looks something like:

```
Issue: [B101:assert_used] Use of assert detected. The enclosed code will be removed when compiling to optimised byte code.
Severity: Low   Confidence: High
Location: ./example.py:3
1    def example1():
2        '''this is a simple example'''
3        assert False
4        return True
```

- **Issue**: Describes the detected issue. Here, Bandit detected the use of `assert`, which is flagged because assert statements can be globally disabled with the `-O` (optimize) switch.
  
- **Severity**: The potential impact of the issue (Low, Medium, High).

- **Confidence**: How sure Bandit is about the detected issue (Low, Medium, High).

- **Location**: The file and line number where the issue was detected.

### 3. **Filtering Results**:

Bandit can produce a lot of output, especially if your codebase is large. You can filter results based on severity and confidence:

```bash
bandit -r . -ll -ii
```

Here:
- `-ll` will only show issues of `Low` severity and higher.
- `-ii` will only show issues of `Low` confidence and higher.

### 4. **Output Formats**:

Bandit can produce output in different formats, which can be useful if you want to integrate it with other tools. For example, to get the output in JSON format:

```bash
bandit -r . -f json -o output.json
```

Here:
- `-f json` tells Bandit to produce output in JSON format.
- `-o output.json` specifies the file where Bandit should save the output.

### 5. **Ignoring Issues**:

If you want to ignore specific issues, you can use the `-s` or `--skip` option:

```bash
bandit -r . -s B101
```

This command will run Bandit and skip any issues with the ID `B101`.

### 6. **Configuration File**:

You can create a `.bandit` configuration file to customize Bandit's behavior. This can include setting default ignored issues, specifying tests to run, and more.

Open Command Prompt or Terminal:

    Navigate to the root directory of your project. This is the directory that contains all the folders you want to scan.

Run Bandit Recursively:

    Use the following command:

    bash

bandit -r .

Here's what the command does:

    bandit: This is the main command to run Bandit.
    -r: This flag tells Bandit to run recursively, meaning it will scan the specified directory and all of its subdirectories.
    .: This specifies the current directory. So, Bandit will scan the directory you're currently in (which should be the root of your project) and all of its subdirectories.
