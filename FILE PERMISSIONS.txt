You've outlined the dangers of improper file permission settings and provided an approach to test and remediate the issue on Linux-based systems. I'll expand on this with a step-by-step guide for each section:

### 1. Test Objectives

Ensure only authorized users can access, read, and modify critical files and directories. Unauthorized access to these files can lead to information leakage, data corruption, and a breach of security boundaries.

### 2. How to Test

#### Tools and Commands:

- **ls**: List the file permissions for a given directory or file.
  
  ```bash
  $ ls -la /PathToCheck/
  ```

- **namei**: Recursively list file permissions.

  ```bash
  $ namei -l /PathToCheck/
  ```

- **find**: Search for files with specific permissions.

  ```bash
  # Find files that are world-writable
  $ find /PathToCheck/ -type f -perm -o+w -exec ls -la {} \;
  
  # Find directories that are world-writable
  $ find /PathToCheck/ -type d -perm -o+w -exec ls -la {} \;
  ```

#### Files/Directories to Check:

- Web files/directory: Especially if serving a web application.
- Configuration files/directory: They may contain sensitive settings and credentials.
- Sensitive files: Such as encryption keys, password files, API tokens.
- Log files: Access to logs can reveal system operation details and potentially sensitive information.
- Executables: Unauthorized modification can lead to malicious code execution.
- Database files/directory: Contains user and possibly confidential data.
- Temp files/directory: Temporary files can sometimes contain sensitive information.
- Upload files/directory: Uploaded files can sometimes be manipulated by attackers if permissions aren't set correctly.

### 3. Remediation

#### Basic Permissions on Linux:

- **Read (r)**: Permission to read the file.
- **Write (w)**: Permission to modify the file.
- **Execute (x)**: Permission to execute the file.

File permissions are usually displayed in three groups: owner, group, and others. 

#### Steps:

1. **Back-Up**: Always back up the data before making any changes.

2. **Ownership**: Ensure that sensitive files are owned by the appropriate user and group. Use `chown` to change the owner and `chgrp` to change the group.

   ```bash
   $ chown username:groupname /PathToFileOrDirectory/
   ```

3. **Set Permissions**: Use `chmod` to set the correct permissions. 

   - For files that should be readable and writable by the owner but not accessible by anyone else:

     ```bash
     $ chmod 600 /PathToFile/
     ```

   - For directories:

     ```bash
     $ chmod 700 /PathToDirectory/
     ```

   - For executables:

     ```bash
     $ chmod 700 /PathToExecutable/
     ```

4. **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit and review file and directory permissions to ensure that they remain secure over time, especially after updates or new software installations.

By following these steps, you'll ensure that only authorized users have access to critical resources on the system, mitigating potential risks arising from misconfigured file permissions.
