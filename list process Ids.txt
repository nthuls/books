Certainly! Here's how you can list process IDs:

1. **On Windows using Command Prompt**:
   You can use the `tasklist` command. This will display a list of currently running tasks, including their process IDs:
   ```
   tasklist
   ```

2. **On Windows using PowerShell**:
   Use the `Get-Process` cmdlet to list all processes:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | Format-Table ProcessName, Id -AutoSize
   ```

3. **On Linux/macOS**:
   Use the `ps` command. The simplest way to see processes and their IDs is:
   ```bash
   ps aux
   ```

   The output columns are:
   - `USER`: the user that owns the process
   - `PID`: the process ID
   - `%CPU`: the CPU usage
   - `%MEM`: the memory usage
   - `VSZ`: the virtual memory size in kilobytes (KB)
   - `RSS`: the resident set size, which is the portion of the process's memory that is held in RAM, measured in KB
   - `TT`: the controlling terminal type for the process (not always present)
   - `STAT`: the process status
   - `STARTED`: the start time of the command
   - `TIME`: the total CPU time used by the task since it started
   - `COMMAND`: the command that started the process

   If you're only interested in the process names and their IDs, you can use:
   ```bash
   ps -eo pid,cmd
   ```

Remember, on Linux systems, the root user or using `sudo` might be required to see all processes if you want a system-wide listing, as a regular user might only see their own processes.
