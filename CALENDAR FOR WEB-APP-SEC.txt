That's great to hear that you're interested in continuing your education in Web Application Security! This field is crucial and ever-evolving, as it encompasses the strategies, protocols, and tools designed to protect web applications from threats and vulnerabilities.

Here are a few areas you might want to explore or focus on:

1. **Understand Web Application Architecture**:
   - Learn how web applications work including the client-server model, HTTP requests and responses, sessions, cookies, and web services.

2. **Master Security Fundamentals**:
   - Study the OWASP Top 10, which is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.
   - Understand common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and security misconfigurations.

3. **Security Testing**:
   - Learn about different security testing methods like static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and interactive application security testing (IAST).
   - Practice using tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and sqlmap for penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

4. **Secure Coding Practices**:
   - Write code with security in mind. Understand secure coding principles and guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities at the source.
   - Learn about input validation, output encoding, authentication and session management, access control, and cryptographic practices.

5. **Incident Response and Monitoring**:
   - Develop skills in identifying and responding to security incidents.
   - Learn about logging, monitoring, and anomaly detection to identify suspicious activities.

6. **Stay Updated**:
   - Keep up with the latest security news, vulnerabilities, and patches.
   - Engage with the security community through forums, social media, and by attending conferences and webinars.

7. **Hands-On Practice**:
   - Set up your own lab environment using tools like Docker or VMs to practice your skills in a safe, controlled setting.
   - Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, which can help sharpen your problem-solving skills and apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.

8. **Legal and Ethical Knowledge**:
   - Understand the legal implications of hacking and ensure that all your testing is ethical and, when performed on live systems, is authorized.

To turn this knowledge into practical skills, consider setting up a home lab or using online resources like Hack The Box, OWASP WebGoat, or PortSwigger Web Security Academy where you can practice in a safe and legal environment.
