Creating a table for `netcat` (often abbreviated as `nc`) commands can be very helpful for quick reference. Here's a simplified table for the `netcat` commands:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-4` | Force `nc` to use IPv4 addresses only. |
| `-6` | Force `nc` to use IPv6 addresses only. |
| `-b bufsize` | Specify buffer size for read operations. Default is 1024 bytes. |
| `-D` | Enable debugging on the socket. |
| `-d` | Do not attempt to read from stdin. |
| `-E` | Use exclusive bind for listening TCP or UDP socket. Requires `-l` option. |
| `-e program` | Execute external program after connection. |
| `-F` | Do not close network socket after EOF on stdin. |
| `-h` | Print `nc` help. |
| `-I bufsize` | Set receive (input) socket buffer size. |
| `-i interval` | Specify a delay time between lines of text sent and received. |
| `-k` | Listen for another connection after the current one is closed. Requires `-l` option. |
| `-L timeout` | Linger on close up to specified timeout in seconds. |
| `-l` | Listen for an incoming connection. |
| `-m byte_count` | Quit after receiving specific bytes. |
| `-N file` | Specifies file with pattern for UDP port scanning. |
| `-n` | Do not do any naming or service lookups. |
| `-O bufsize` | Set send (output) socket buffer size. |
| `-P proxy_username` | Specify a username for proxy server authentication. |
| `-p port` | Specify the source or listen port. |
| `-q timeout` | After EOF on stdin, wait for specified seconds and quit. |
| `-R addr/port[/proto]` | Perform port redirection to a given host and port. |
| `-r` | Choose destination ports randomly. |
| `-s source_ip_address` | Specify the IP for sending packets. |
| `-S sla-prop` | Specify properties of the MAC flow for the socket. |
| `-T dscp` | Specify Differentiated Services Code Point for the connection. |
| `-t` | Send RFC 854 DON'T and WON'T responses to DO and WILL requests. |
| `-U` | Use Unix Domain Sockets. |
| `-u` | Use UDP instead of TCP. |
| `-v` | Verbose output. |
| `-w timeout` | Close connection if idle for more than specified seconds. |
| `-X proxy_protocol` | Specify protocol for proxy server. |
| `-x proxy_address[:port]` | Connect using a proxy at specified address and port. |
| `-Z` | Bind to address/port in all zones. |
| `-z` | Perform port scan. |

**Additional Commands:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-C` | Send CRLF as line-ending. |
| `-G gateway` | Source-routing hop point[s], up to 8. |
| `-g gateway` | Loose source-routing hop point[s], up to 8. |
| `-M secret` | Shared secret for TCP MD5 SIG (RFC2385). |
| `-o file` | Hex dump of traffic. |
| `-c` | Close connection on socket close. |

This table provides a condensed overview of the `netcat` command options. It's recommended to refer to the man pages (`man nc`) or official documentation for detailed explanations and usage examples.
