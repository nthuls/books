Instance 1: PHPBB 2.0.12 - Authentication Bypass via unserialize() and Loose Comparison

Core Issue:

The code uses unserialize() on user-supplied data without validation, which is inherently insecure.
Loose comparison with == between a supposed MD5 hash string and a boolean true value allows an attacker to bypass authentication because a non-empty string is considered equal to true.
Exploit Mechanism:

An attacker crafts a cookie value with a serialized string containing autologinid set to boolean true and a manipulated userid.
The PHP == operator considers the string hash equivalent to true, granting access without a valid password.
Notes for Mitigation:

Always use strict comparison (===) in PHP to prevent type juggling vulnerabilities.
Do not use unserialize() on user input. If you must, implement integrity checks such as signature verification.
Replace MD5 with a more robust hashing algorithm and use PHP's password_verify() for password checks.

Instance 2: PHPBB 2.0.13 - Authentication Bypass via MD5 and Loose Comparison

Core Issue:

The password is hashed with MD5 and compared using loose comparison, which can be fooled when the hash is compared to a boolean true.
Exploit Mechanism:

The attacker alters the cookie with a serialized string that forces $row['user_password'] to be a boolean true.
Since any hashed password string loosely equals true, the comparison md5($password) == $row['user_password'] is bypassed.
Notes for Mitigation:

Strictly compare hashes using === to avoid type juggling.
Move away from MD5 for password storage and comparisons. Utilize password_hash() and password_verify() for password security in PHP.
Never trust user input. Cookies should not directly influence authentication logic without rigorous checking.
General Notes on PHP Type Juggling and Loose Comparisons:

PHP’s == operator performs type conversion if the operands are different types. This can lead to true being considered equal to any non-empty string, which is the root of these vulnerabilities.
An MD5 hash is a 32-character hex string. In PHP, when compared using ==, this hash will be considered true if compared against a boolean true.
It is critical for security-sensitive operations to use type-safe practices to ensure that the data types are as expected.
Conclusion and Best Practices:

Use strict typing (=== and !==) to compare variables.
Avoid using weak hash functions like MD5 for anything security-related.
Do not deserialize user input without rigorous validation.
Regularly update and patch software to fix known security issues.
Follow security best practices, such as OWASP guidelines, when handling authentication and user input.
