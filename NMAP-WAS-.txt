Certainly! Nmap is a highly versatile tool with a plethora of options and techniques for network scanning and reconnaissance. Here are several techniques you can employ using Nmap:

### 1. **Ping Scan (Host Discovery):**
To check if the host is online and skip port scanning:

```bash
nmap -sn www.example.com
```

### 2. **Basic Port Scan:**
Scan the 1,000 most common ports:

```bash
nmap www.example.com
```

### 3. **Specific Port Scan:**
Scan specific ports or ranges:

```bash
nmap -p 20-25,80,443 www.example.com
```

### 4. **All Ports Scan:**
Scan all 65,535 ports:

```bash
nmap -p- www.example.com
```

### 5. **Service Version Detection:**
Determine service and version information:

```bash
nmap -sV www.example.com
```

### 6. **Operating System Detection:**
Guess the operating system:

```bash
nmap -O www.example.com
```

### 7. **Aggressive Scan:**
This combines several options (`-O`, `-sV`, `-T4`, and more) for a more aggressive and faster scan:

```bash
nmap -A www.example.com
```

### 8. **TCP SYN Scan (Stealth Scan):**
Performs a scan without completing the three-way handshake, making it less likely to be detected by intrusion detection systems:

```bash
nmap -sS www.example.com
```

### 9. **TCP Connect Scan:**
This scan completes the TCP three-way handshake:

```bash
nmap -sT www.example.com
```

### 10. **UDP Scan:**
Scans for open UDP ports:

```bash
nmap -sU www.example.com
```

### 11. **Script Scanning:**
Nmap has a scripting engine that allows users to write and execute scripts to perform various tasks. The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) includes numerous predefined scripts:

```bash
nmap --script=default www.example.com
```

### 12. **Timing Templates:**
Nmap offers timing templates to control the speed of the scan:

```bash
nmap -T4 www.example.com  # Options range from T0 (slowest) to T5 (fastest)
```

### 13. **Save Scan Outputs:**
You can save scan outputs in various formats:

```bash
nmap -oN output.txt www.example.com  # Normal output
nmap -oX output.xml www.example.com  # XML output
```

### 14. **Firewall Evasion Techniques:**
Nmap provides several techniques to bypass firewalls, such as fragmenting packets:

```bash
nmap -f www.example.com
```

### 15. **Decoy Scanning:**
Make it harder for the target to determine the real source of the scan:

```bash
nmap -D RND:10 www.example.com  # Uses random decoys
nmap -D decoy1,decoy2,me www.example.com  # Uses specific decoys with 'me' representing the actual scanning machine
```

These are just a few of the numerous techniques and options available with Nmap. Always refer to the official Nmap documentation or use the `man nmap` command to explore more options and details. 

**Note:** Ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any network or system. Unauthorized scanning is both unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions.
