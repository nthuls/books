To uninstall applications from the command line in Windows, you can use PowerShell or Command Prompt with the appropriate methods:

### Using PowerShell:

1. **For Traditional Programs**:
   
   First, you can list all installed programs with:
   ```powershell
   Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | Select-Object Name
   ```

   To uninstall a specific program, use the following command (replace "ProgramName" with the exact name of the program):
   ```powershell
   Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object { $_.Name -match "ProgramName" } | ForEach-Object { $_.Uninstall() }
   ```

2. **For Windows Store Apps**:
   
   First, list all installed store apps with:
   ```powershell
   Get-AppxPackage | Select-Object Name, PackageFullName
   ```

   To uninstall a specific store app, use the following command (replace "PackageFullName" with the exact full name from the list):
   ```powershell
   Get-AppxPackage PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage
   ```

### Using Command Prompt:

1. **Using `wmic`**:
   
   First, you can list all installed programs with:
   ```bash
   wmic product get name
   ```

   To uninstall a specific program, use:
   ```bash
   wmic product where name="ProgramName" call uninstall
   ```
   Replace "ProgramName" with the exact name of the program.

**Note**: Be careful when using these commands, especially the uninstall commands. Ensure you are targeting the correct application. Additionally, using the `Win32_Product` class in `Get-WmiObject` can be slow and might trigger a consistency check on installed programs, so use it judiciously.
